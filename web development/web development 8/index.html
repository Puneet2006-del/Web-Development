    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary</p>
    <h2>Block Elements</h2>
    <p>Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire
        width of their container by default. They essentially claim all the horizontal space for 
        themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line.
